The U.S. Justice System has increasingly been using data-driven decision making algorithms to predict the likelihood of future criminal recidivism for defendants (i.e. whether the defendant will commit another crime in the future). These algorithmic predictions are utilised in the courtrooms to make sentencing decisions for defendants (e.g. setting the bond amount; whether the defendant is set free). <br><br> In this study, our goal is to assess how fair you believe different predictive algorithms are when compared with the defendantsâ€™ true outcomes. You will be offered a series of questions for which you need to choose which algorithm makes predictions that are less discriminatory. <br><br>The session will consist of {{numtests}} questions. Each question consists of a list of 10 (hypothetical) individuals, along with their demographic information, the predictions made for them by two different algorithms (we will refer to these as the predicted outcomes), and whether they actually committed another crime (we will refer to this as their true outcomes). You will be asked to select that algorithm that you believe is less discriminatory, and fill out the explanation accordingly. Note that every question corresponds to a different set of individuals and algorithms. Therefore, information provided in previous questions should not affect your choice for the current and upcoming questions. <br><br>The expected response time for a single question is less than 3 minutes. If you do not complete a single question within 30 minutes, the task will time out and will be marked as incomplete. You will be compensated for your time only if you complete the task. <br><br> The complete information sheet for this study (goals, procedures, risks, etc.) can be found <a href='/static/information/infosheet.pdf' target='_blank'>here</a>.
